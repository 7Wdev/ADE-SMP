# ADE-SMP
ADE-SMP Is An Open Sourced Minecraft Cross Platfrom SMP Server.
It Is Mainly Maintained And Hosted By Ade Issawe aka (7Wdev/Ade216), I Decided To Make It Open Sourced So That It Can Be Controlled And Maintained By Community Out There.
They Might Provide Such Contributions As:
- Adding New Features
- Fixing Bugs
- Doing Security Patches
- Building Worlds,Lobbies And Maps
etc...

By Open Sourcing The Server We Enables The Opportunity To Maintain It Faster And In A Proffessional Way That Is Based On Creativity And Cooperation Of The Community!
Also It Makes The Server More Secure By Increasing The Rate Of Releasing Security Patches.
So Yea Read All The ReadME File And Have Fun Playing, Creating, And Innovating In ADE-SMP!
